# Module Two Portfolio

## Description

In this assignment, we were asked to create a portfolio website that would
be able to show potential employers what we know. This website uses different CSS stylings and HTML elements that I have learned. Honestly,
it doesn't look good at all right now, and I will be updating this in the near future to make it look better.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Right now, the website shows my profile picture, a description about me, and the homework assignment we did in module 1. There is also some contact info at the bottom of the page. Again, I will be updating this with more assignments as the year goes along, and I will make the website not so ugly.
